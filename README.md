# PHOTOGRAPHY-PORTFOLIO-FRONT-END-PROJECT
**Type:** Frontend Web Development
**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Project Overview:**
DreamPixel is a responsive and interactive portfolio website designed to showcase photography work in a creative, user-friendly format. It features a modern UI with a soft pastel linear gradient background (pink, purple, and blue), a dark/light mode toggle, interactive image filtering, and a responsive gallery layout to make the user experience visually appealing across all devices.

**Key Features:**
1. Visually Appealing Design: Light linear gradient background using shades of pink, purple, and blue for a calm, elegant aesthetic. Glassmorphism effects with blur and transparency in section containers. Smooth hover effects on images and buttons for modern UX.
2. Dark/Light Theme Toggle: A JavaScript-based button allows users to switch between light and dark themes dynamically. CSS classes are toggled to invert colors and backgrounds smoothly.
3. Image Filtering System: Filter buttons (All, Landscape, Urban, People) let users dynamically display relevant photos. JavaScript listens to button clicks and shows/hides corresponding categories.
4. Fully Responsive Layout: Grid-based gallery layout using CSS Grid and media queries. Optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
5. Contact Form: A simple form with fields for name, email, and message. Alert message on submit (can be connected to backend/email services later).
6. Subtle Animations: Buttons scale on hover. Images zoom slightly with shadow on hover for a premium feel.
7. Portfolio Focused: Designed specifically for photographers or creatives to present their work. Can easily be adapted for artists, designers, or agencies.
